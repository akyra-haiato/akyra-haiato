## About me

Hello everyone! Nice to meet you. 
I'm not very good at introductions so here's my take: 

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on indie game projects! 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning JS/HTML/CSS for Software Development, Godot for Game Dev. 
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on anything Software Dev/Game Dev related!
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about my games! Or anything really! 
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: through my email (akyrahaiato@gmail.com) or my instagram (@akyrahaiato)! 
- âš¡ Fun fact: I don't know what I'm doing :)
